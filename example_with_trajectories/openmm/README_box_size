LX >= 2 LminX 
LY = max{LminX , LminY}

LminX = 2 (rP + 3 rL + dres + XM) ~ = 2 (rP + dres + XM + 24) (Angstrom)
LminY = (Ap + dSA)/ (2 XM)

dres = (kBT / kr)^(1/2)

Lmin,X: Minimum box size of a bilayer along the X-dimension in the BBS
        to include at least three lipid shells around an embedded MP

Lmin,Y: Minimum box size of a bilyaer along the Y-dimension in the BBS
        so that the area of mixing zone,  2 * XM * LY >= AP.
        XM can be calculated from this relation for given AP and LY

XM    : Width of mixing zone (at one side of the bilayer)
AP    : Area of MP, AP = 2 pi rP^2
dSA   : Difference in SA between two bilayers B1 and B2 (used for the BBS generation)
rP    : Effective radius of peptide
rL    : Effective radius of lipids (an estimate, AL = 64.0 A^2 => rL = 8 A)
dres  : Root mean penetration depth a lipid to non-native bilayer along X-dimension
        starting from the edge of the mixing zone. 
kBT   : Thermal energy; kB - the Boltzmann constant; T - temperature
kr    : Force constant of the binary bilayer restraining potential, V(X)
        V(X) = kr/2 * (X-Xref). For B1, Xref = LX/4. For B2, Xref = -LX/4.
